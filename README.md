<b>Introduction</b><br><br>

The Checkers AI Game is a modern digital version of the classic board game Checkers,
designed to combine entertainment with artificial intelligence. In this game,
players move their pieces diagonally across the board and capture opponent pieces
by jumping over them. The primary objective is to eliminate all opponent pieces or
block them from making any legal moves.

By converting the traditional board game into a digital format, players can enjoy
checkers anytime and anywhere without requiring a physical board.

The integration of artificial intelligence makes the game more engaging. The AI
opponent analyzes possible moves, plans strategies, and adapts to different play
styles. This ensures challenging gameplay for both beginners and experienced
players while also serving as an educational learning tool.
